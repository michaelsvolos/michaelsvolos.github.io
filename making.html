		<h2>Simulating the Reverberation of Cities</h2>
			<p>For my honors capstone project, I used the image source method to simulate the reverberant sound of city streets. Impulse responses were created in MATLAB for use in convolution reverb plugins. <a href="http://michaelsvolos.github.io/reverb_paper.pdf">Paper</a> <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~msvolos/demos/demo.aif">Demo</a></p>
		<h2>Classifying Musical Scores by Instrument</h2>
			<p>This was a project for CS 221 - Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques. We created an algorithm that takes digital representations of individual instrument parts from Classical-era pieces and classifies them by instrument. <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~msvolos/cs221/CS221_Project_Final_Report.pdf">Paper</a></p>
		<h2>Switchboard</h2>
			<p>Switchboard is a new musical instrument created for Music 250A - Physical Interaction Design. It was built using Faust running on an Arduino Teensy 3.6. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjKJGZvyAI4">Video demo</a></p>
		<h2>Adtune</h2>
			<p>Adtune is a computer music-mediated reminder of just how many ads are out there. It's a Google Chrome extensions that, when activated, counts the number of ads on the current website and synthesizes and plays a song. On a site with no ads, the music is relaxing, but this quickly changes once the number of ads goes up. Adtune is a project for Treehacks 2019. <a href="https://github.com/michaelsvolos/adtune">Github</a></p>
